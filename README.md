This is my take on the PistonDev's "Getting Started" tutorial, which I built on a dare. It features the use of piston's keyboard support to move the square around. Take it. Hold it. Mod it. Love it. 

Note: I used SDL2 rather than GLFW because at the time that I wrote this, GLFW would not build properly.
